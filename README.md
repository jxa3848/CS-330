How do I approach designing software? I make an outline of what the client needs. After I'll take it over with the team and see if things are missing are do we need to add things to reach the cleints end goal. Finally I go back to the client and talk over the needs and show them how the software will work to see if they like the design.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? A better understanding of how the xyz axis work when rendering a scene. I also learn how to add mouse and keybord controlles to a project.

What design process did you follow for your project work? I make an outline  then code the requirements then compare it to both the outline and the requirements.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? Making an outline then checking the project against it  will help with all projects as it will help me not miss anything.

How do I approach developing programs?  I use the same approach that I do for  software. Make an outline with the requirements see if other things will be needed then shoe client how it will work.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? I tried to sketch on paper how I wanted things to look like then recreate it in the program.

How did iteration factor into your development? It made it easier as we did the same thing over and over like it burned it into my mind.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? I have learned to take more time with the projects as even with the repetition

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? My goal is to find a work from home job with good stability and more of those job want a computer science back round.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? Learning how the code for the light interacts with the material witch will help me remember that I need to look at how code interacts with other code.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? If I find a career in video games adding controls is a fundemantal part of that. Every milestone we did can be used in making a video game.
